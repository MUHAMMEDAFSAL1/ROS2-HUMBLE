üöÄ Introduction to ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill

ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill is the eighth official release of the Robot Operating System (ROS) 2, and it is designated as a Long-Term Support (LTS) release, ensuring support and updates until May 2027. This release is optimized for Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish) and is designed to enhance the development of robotic applications across various platforms, including Windows 10 and macOS.

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is not an operating system ‚Äî it‚Äôs a framework that provides tools, libraries, and conventions for building robot applications. It helps different parts of a robot (sensors, motors, processors) communicate easily.
üß† ROS 2 Core Concepts
Concept	Description
Node	A single executable that performs computation.
üí° Example: motor_controller_node
Topic	A communication channel used by nodes to publish or subscribe messages (1-to-many).
Publisher	Sends messages to a topic so others can receive them.
Subscriber	Listens for messages on a topic to receive updates.
Message	A predefined data structure sent between nodes.
üìù Example: geometry_msgs/msg/Vector3
Service	A two-way synchronous communication. One node sends a request, another replies.
Action	Used for long-running tasks that give feedback and can be canceled (e.g., navigation).
Parameter	Configuration variable set at runtime to modify node behavior.
Launch	A file that starts multiple nodes and sets parameters automatically.
Package	A directory structure that contains source code, launch files, config, etc.



# üß† What is a Node in ROS 2?
A Node is the smallest executable unit in ROS 2. Think of it as a single program/module in your robot.
### üîß Notes about ROS Nodes

- Each node does one job (e.g., reading sensors, controlling motors, etc.).
- Multiple nodes can run simultaneously and communicate with each other.
- Nodes can be written in **Python** or **C++**.
# üì¶ Example from a Drone:
Let‚Äôs say your drone has these parts:
| Component         | ROS Node                  |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| IMU Sensor        | `/imu_node`               |
| GPS               | `/gps_node`               |
| Motor Controller  | `/motorABLE_controller_node` |
| Flight Control    | `/flight_controller_node` |
| Camera            | `/camera_node`            |


Each of these runs as a separate node, and they communicate using topics, services, or actions.
### üí¨ Node Communication Types

- **Topics** ‚Äì For streaming data (like sensor values or commands)  
  üëâ *Example:* `/imu/data`, `/cmd_vel`

- **Services** ‚Äì For request-response actions (like taking a photo)

- **Actions** ‚Äì For long-running tasks (like navigating to a waypoint)

### üîß Creating a Node (Python Example)

```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node

class HelloNode(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('hello_node')
        self.get_logger().info("Hello from ROS 2 Node!")

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    node = HelloNode()
    rclpy.spin(node)
    rclpy.shutdown()
