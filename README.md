# 🧠 What is a Node in ROS 2?
A Node is the smallest executable unit in ROS 2. Think of it as a single program/module in your robot.
# ✅ Key Points:
    Each node does one job (e.g., reading sensors, controlling motors, etc.).

    Multiple nodes can run simultaneously and communicate with each other.

    Written in Python or C++.

# 📦 Example from a Drone:
Let’s say your drone has these parts:
|Component | 	ROS Node | 
|----------|----------|
|IMU Sensor   | Data     | 
| Row 2    | Values   | 


Each of these runs as a separate node, and they communicate using topics, services, or actions.
